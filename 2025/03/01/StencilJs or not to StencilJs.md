# StencilJs or not to StencilJs at Zawjen

One of our Frontend team volunteers from Brazil,Â **[Hugo Machado de Almeida](https://linkedin.com/in/hv90-m182)**Â wrote an excellent suggestion about [StencilJs.com](StencilJs.com). It is a library for building reusable, scalable component libraries. The creator of the library claims that it generates small, blazing fastÂ `Web Components`Â that run everywhereÂ `React`,Â `NextJs`,Â `Angular`Â andÂ `Vue`Â or evenÂ `Vanilla Html/Js`.

I am interested inÂ [`Storybook`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook)Â andÂ [`StencilJs`](https://github.com/stenciljs/core)Â because it encapsulatesÂ `UX`Â for a large project likeÂ `Zawjen`. Potentially we will be usingÂ `NextJs`Â and may not be using multiple frameworks likeÂ `React`,Â `NextJs`,Â `Angular`Â orÂ `Vue`. However, we will be building a large number of websites for internal and external use usingÂ `NextJs`.

I seeÂ `StencilJs`Â has a potential to encapsulateÂ UXÂ for all of our websites.Â StencilJsÂ components can provide a single source of truth forÂ Web ComponentsÂ for all of the websites, or for right nowÂ [`web-zawjen`](https://github.com/zawjen/web-zawjen)Â andÂ [`web-zawjen-admin`](https://github.com/zawjen/web-zawjen-admin).

I can see a promise ofÂ `StencilJs`Â supportingÂ `NextJs`Â SSR. But this has to be validated by doing aÂ `POC` using `NextJs 15` and `React 19`. We need to understand the bundle size of our website and performance with or withoutÂ `StencilJs`.

So far, I have noticed thatÂ `StencilJs`, does not supportÂ `ReactNative`. So, for ourÂ `ReactNative`Â mobile app,Â [`app-zawjen`](https://github.com/zawjen/app-zawjen), we may need to think of another strategy.Â StorybookÂ does supportÂ ReactNativeÂ , which is a good news.

The community ofÂ `StencilJs`Â withÂ **12.7K**Â Github stars is not as strong asÂ `Storybook`Â **85K**Â stars, but it is built by the same team that developed once popularÂ `ionic`Â library. Also it is backed by a very largeÂ `low code`Â companyÂ [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/).

Nonetheless, we would require a carefulÂ `POC`Â to see the results. I discovered a few articles and repos showing how to do just right

-   [stenciljs-with-storybook](https://dev.to/jfgmdev/stenciljs-with-storybook-3027)
-   [stencil-storybook-boilerplate](https://github.com/artursopelnik/stencil-storybook-boilerplate)

I hopeÂ `Hugo`Â can do a POC and share results in a blog post.

May Allah guide us in the right direction. Ameen ğŸŒ¿ğŸŒ¿ğŸŒ¿
