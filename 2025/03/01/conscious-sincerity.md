# Conscious Sincerity

There are ways to become sincere.

At Zawjen.net, you can write a one-minute blog post or a Canva video, no matter how small of a thing you learnt. e.g. install git, select between Next.js 18 or 19, NestJs, ElasticSearch, Process, UX design, Datasets.

While giving money to some needy people, do not hand over money. Ask them about what they do, their family, where they live, their sons, and their daughters. Then hand over money.

There should be a conscious effort to become Sincere.

May Allah bless you and your family ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿
