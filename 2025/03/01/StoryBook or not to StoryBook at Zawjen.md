# Storybook or not to Storybook at Zawjen

An excellent UX suggestion about Storybook from **[Sidra Waseem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidramwaseem/)**, a volunteer UX Designer at Zawjen.net

I used a Storybook in one of the financial product AARP Money Map. Because it was just one website without much reuse, developers often forget to update Storybook and it stays in a crashed state. So, if not maintained properly, the Storybook version of components might differ from the real app behavior.

The good thing about Storybook is that people across the world can develop and test UI components in isolation without worrying about app dependencies. It has Powerful plugins like accessibility testing, viewport adjustments, and interaction testing. The best thing perhaps is that Designers and product managers can review components without needing to run the full app.

So skip Storybook if youâ€™re working on a simple project, a backend-heavy app, or if maintaining separate stories is too much overhead.

Use Storybook if youâ€™re working on a large-scale app like Zawjen, design system, or reusable UI library. It improves modularity and speeds up UI development. Zawjen is not a design system, or reusable UI library, but with our efforts we can give the world the best design system, or reusable UI library.

People around the world are seeing your open source work and your next great opportunity lies in building a great design system, or reusable UI library.

Zawjen will have dozens and dozens of websites and apps eventually for internal and external use.

I recommend Storybook.

May Allah guide us in the right direction. Ameen ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿
