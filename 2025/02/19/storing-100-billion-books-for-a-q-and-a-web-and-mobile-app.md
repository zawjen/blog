# Storing 100 Billion Books for a Q&A Web and Mobile App

## Introduction
Imagine a vast digital library containing **100 billion books**, covering **100 knowledge categories**‚Äîfrom religion to science, medicine to history, cities to tribes‚Äîeach book spanning thousands of pages, sentences, and words. Now, picture this data being searchable in **1,000 languages** with both **keyword-based** and **AI-powered semantic search** capabilities.

This isn‚Äôt just an ambitious idea; it‚Äôs a real challenge for anyone building a large-scale **Q&A web and mobile app**. In this article, we will explore how to efficiently store, search, and retrieve this massive dataset using cutting-edge technologies like **Elasticsearch, FAISS, BM25 ranking, and NLP-based search**.



## **Understanding the Scale of the Challenge**
Each book in our system can have:
- **1 to 900 volumes**, each with **500 to 5,000 pages**
- **500 to 3,000 words per page** (~100KB per page)
- **Sentences marked as truth (green), lie (red), or doubtful (yellow)**
- **Multiple word meanings, each with 950 attributes**
- **Supporting materials** (PDFs, audio, video, images) classified as green, red, or yellow
- **Authorship references to 6,000 books**
- **Information derived from 7,000 books**

Storing and querying **1 billion books per category** requires an efficient **data structure, indexing strategy, and retrieval mechanism**.



## **Database Selection: Elasticsearch vs. Alternatives**
Elasticsearch stands out as a **powerful, distributed search engine**, but are there alternatives? Let‚Äôs compare:

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|------------|------|------|
| **Elasticsearch** | Fast full-text + vector search, scalable | Expensive at large scale |
| **Solr** | Open-source, highly customizable | Higher operational complexity |
| **Milvus** | Optimized for vector search | Needs external storage for text data |
| **Weaviate** | GraphQL-powered hybrid search | Smaller community support |
| **Annoy (Spotify)** | Memory-efficient vector search | Slower than FAISS |
| **HNSWlib** | High recall, fast | High RAM usage |

For **hybrid search**, **Elasticsearch + FAISS** is the best combination.



## **Indexing 100 Billion Books in Elasticsearch**
### **Index Structure**
We use **separate indices for different data layers**:
- **index_books** (metadata, categories, references)
- **index_pages** (full text, sentences, attributes)
- **index_words** (dictionary meanings, multilingual support)
- **index_authors** (book-page-sentence references instead of just names)
- **index_materials** (PDFs, audio, video, classified by trust level)

### **Sharding Strategy**
- Each **category gets its own shards** to balance data load.
- **Index hot books separately** for faster lookups.
- **Cross-cluster search (CCS)** distributes queries efficiently.



## **Searching 100 Billion Books: BM25, FAISS, and NLP**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Keyword Search with BM25**
BM25 ranks documents based on:
- **Term Frequency (TF)**: How often a word appears.
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: How unique the word is.
- **Document Length Normalization**: Adjusting scores for long vs. short documents.

#### **Example Query:**
_"In Allah‚Äôs name, the Most Merciful, the Most Beneficent."_
- BM25 finds exact matches in Quran translations.
- **Pros:** Fast, scalable.
- **Cons:** Doesn't understand word meanings.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Semantic Search with FAISS**
FAISS stores **vector embeddings** of books, pages, and words, enabling **nearest neighbor searches**.
- **Example:** Finding verses with a similar meaning to _"Allah‚Äôs mercy is boundless."_
- **Pros:** Finds meaning-based matches.
- **Cons:** Needs high RAM for large-scale indexing.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Hybrid Search: FAISS + Elasticsearch BM25**
- Query **FAISS** for **semantic similarity**.
- Query **Elasticsearch** for **keyword ranking**.
- Combine results using **ranking models** (LTR, weighted scoring).



## **Handling 100 Million Queries Per Second (QPS)**
### **Choosing the Right API Framework**
| API | Performance | Scalability | Cost |
|------|------------|------------|------|
| **FastAPI (REST)** | Very High | Excellent | Low |
| **NestJS (REST)** | High | Good | Medium |
| **GraphQL** | Medium | Complex | High |

üîπ **Verdict:** **FastAPI** is the best for handling 100M QPS.



## **Optimizing Frequently Accessed Books (Hot Indexing)**
Some books are referenced **millions of times**, requiring special treatment:
- **Hot indices:** Store frequently accessed books separately.
- **Caching:** Use Elasticsearch query caching for speed.
- **Dedicated nodes:** Assign powerful nodes to "hot" books.



## **Milvus + Elasticsearch for Advanced Vector Search**
If FAISS becomes costly, **Milvus** is a solid alternative:
- Store **text data** in Elasticsearch.
- Store **vector embeddings** in Milvus.
- Query both and **merge results dynamically**.

## **Conclusion: The Future of AI-Powered Book Search**
Storing and searching **100 billion books** isn‚Äôt just about **big data**; it‚Äôs about **making knowledge accessible**. Using **Elasticsearch, FAISS, BM25, and NLP**, we can build a **blazing-fast, intelligent Q&A system** for any **web or mobile app**.

Are you ready to revolutionize search?
